    - [Getting Started With the VIP Clean Architecture Pattern](https://www.kodeco.com/29416318-getting-started-with-the-vip-clean-architecture-pattern)

## Installation

* To install, look inside `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/`. If you already have the `Custom Templates` folder created, paste the root folder from this project inside it. If not, create the `Custom Templates` folder and paste the root folder inside.
    
## Usage

#### Create new Project

* Open Xcode
    - **File** > **New** > **Project** or press shortcuts **â‡§âŒ˜N**
* First, create all groups for your Scenes following the pattern: Domain/Scenes
* Second, create a folder with the Scene Name
* Than, create a new file: 
    - **File** > **New** or press shortcuts **â‡§âŒ˜N**

## Tech debits:

- [ ] Groups: The template should be inteligent enought to create all the groups for the user, but I had some problems with that... ðŸ˜ª
- [ ] An installer: must be created an installer. Today, all the installation process is manual.
